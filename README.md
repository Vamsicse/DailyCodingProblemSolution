#### Problem 1
Google Intern Interview Question

Given a list of numbers, return whether any two sums to k. For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

#### Problem 2

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

#### Problem 4

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.

You can modify the input array in-place.

#### Problem 9

This problem was asked by Airbnb and Uber.

Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

For example, [2, 4, 6, 8] should return 12, since we pick 4 and 8. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.

#### Problem 10
This problem was asked by Apple.

Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and calls f after n milliseconds.

#### Problem 11

This problem was asked by Twitter.

Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].

Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.

#### Problem 23
This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an M by N matrix consisting of booleans that represents a board. Each True boolean represents a wall. Each False boolean represents a tile you can walk on.

Given this matrix, a start coordinate, and an end coordinate, return the minimum number of steps required to reach the end coordinate from the start. If there is no possible path, then return null. You can move up, left, down, and right. You cannot move through walls. You cannot wrap around the edges of the board.

For example, given the following board:

[[f, f, f, f],

 [t, t, f, t],

[f, f, f, f],

[f, f, f, f]]
and start = (3, 0) (bottom left) and end = (0, 0) (top left), the minimum number of steps required to reach the end is 7, since we would need to go through (1, 2) because there is a wall everywhere else on the second row.

Also referred as Shortest Path Binary Maze problem.

#### Problem 26

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a singly linked list and an integer k, remove the kth last element from the list. k is guaranteed to be smaller than the length of the list.

The list is very long, so making more than one pass is prohibitively expensive.

Do this in constant space and in one pass.

#### Problem 27

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed).

For example, given the string "([])", you should return true.

Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false.

#### Problem 30

This problem was asked by Illumina

Rain Water Trapping: You are given an array of non-negative integers that represents a two-dimensional elevation map where each element is unit-width wall and the integer is the height. Suppose it will rain and all spots between two walls get filled up.

Compute how many units of water remain trapped on the map in O(N) time and O(1) space.

For example, given the input [2, 1, 2], we can hold 1 unit of water in the middle.

Given the input [3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5], we can hold 3 units in the first index, 2 in the second, and 3 in the fourth index (we cannot hold 5 since it would run off to the left), so we can trap 8 units of water.

#### Problem 47

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

[Solution](solution/BuySellStock.java)

#### Problem 52
This problem was asked by Google, WalmartLabs.

Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size n, and contain the following methods:

set(key, value): sets key to value. If there are already n items in the cache and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the least recently used item. get(key): gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null. Each operation should run in O(1) time.

#### Problem 77

This problem was asked by Walmart Labs and Snapchat.

Given a list of possibly overlapping intervals, return a new list of intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged.

The input list is not necessarily ordered in any way.

For example, given [(1, 3), (5, 8), (4, 10), (20, 25)], you should return [(1, 3), (4, 10), (20, 25)].

#### Problem 78

This problem was asked by Google.

Given k sorted singly linked lists, write a function to merge all the lists into one sorted singly linked list.

[Solution](solution/MergeKSortedLinkedLists.java)

#### Problem 102

This problem was asked by Lyft.

Given a list of integers and a number K, return which contiguous elements of the list sum to K.

For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and K is 9, then it should return [2, 3, 4].

[Solution](solution/SubArraySum.java)

#### Problem 133

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a node in a binary tree, return the next bigger element, also known as the inorder successor. (NOTE: I'm assuming this is a binary search tree, because otherwise, the problem makes no sense at all).

For example, the inorder successor of 22 is 30.

    10
   
   /   \
  
  5    30
 
     /  \

    22    35
    
You can assume each node has a parent pointer.

#### Problem 140

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given an array of integers in which two elements appear exactly once and all other elements appear exactly twice, find the two elements that appear only once.

For example, given the array [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 2, 6, 10], return 4 and 8. The order does not matter.

Follow-up: Can you do this in linear time and constant space?

#### Problem 282

This problem was asked by Netflix.

Given an array of integers, determine whether it contains a Pythagorean triplet. Recall that a Pythogorean triplet (a, b, c) is defined by the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2.

Find TopKFrequentElements in a list.
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

#### Problem 368

Find maximum possible stolen value from houses.

There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it. A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbour left and right side. What is the maximum stolen value.

Input  : hval[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 4}
Output : 19
Thief will steal 6, 1, 8 and 4 from house.

Input  : hval[] = {5, 3, 4, 11, 2}
Output : 16
Thief will steal 5 and 11

#### Problem 369

Find Minimum Number of Platforms Required for a Railway/Bus Station.
Given arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station, the task is to find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train waits.
We are given two arrays which represent arrival and departure times of trains that stop.
   
   arr[] = {9:00, 9:40, 9:50, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00}

   dep[] = {9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00}
       
Output: 3

There are at-most three trains at a time (time between 11:00 to 11:20)
